# Ground War
A Java implementation of Ground War, a board game I made in the spring of 2015. The original rules can be found in rules.pdf, and the board in board.jpg (the original board didn't have the tile numbering). I've changed both since then.  
  
For the original C++ implementation, [see here](https://github.com/LucasPickering/Ground-War-Cpp).
  
Uses the Lightweight Java Game Library.  
### Installation instructions for Development:
#### IntelliJ
1. Clone the repo
2. Import the project from pom.xml
3. Run the class GroundWar

### Extra Info
You can run the game with LWJGL debugging enabled by putting -Dorg.lwjgl.util.Debug=true in the VM options.
