# Ground War
A Java implementation of Ground War, a board game I made in the spring of 2015. The original rules can be found in rules.pdf, and the board in board.jpg (the original board didn't have the tile numbering). I've changed both since then.  
  
For the original C++ implementation, [see here](https://github.com/LucasPickering/Ground-War-Cpp).
  
Uses the Lightweight Java Game Library.  
### Installation instructions:
1. Clone the repo
2. Download [LWJGL 3](http://lwjgl.org)
3. Open the repo in your IDE
4. Link LWJGL to your project (IDE specific)
5. In the VM launch options, add "-Djava.library.path=/path/to/lwjgl/native" (the native folder should be in the LWJGL installation you extracted)
